# Project Brief: CAB302 Wellbeing Software Group Project

## Project Title:
Interval Training App

## Project Description:
The Interval Training app is a mobile application designed to allow users to create custom interval training routines according to their fitness goals and preferences. The app provides a user-friendly interface for accessing pre-designed programs and tracking progress. With features such as fitness tracking, program sharing, and various types of interval training modes, the app aims to provide users with a comprehensive solution to improve their fitness and well-being.

## Objectives:
The objectives of the Interval Training App include:
1.	**User Empowerment:** Allow users to control their fitness journey by providing a range of interval training routines including running, cycling, weightlifting, and circuit training.
2.	**Enhance Fitness:** Enable users to improve their overall fitness levels.
3.	**Enable Progress Tracking:** Allow users the ability to track workout performance, monitor their progress and adjust training intensity/duration.
4.	**Encourage Community Engagement:** Create an environment allowing users to share their workout routines, achievements, and experiences.

## Scope:
The Interval Training App aims to provide users with a comprehensive and customizable platform to improve their fitness via interval training. The app will allow users to design personalized workout routines based on their fitness goals and preferences. Users will be able to create custom intervals, rest periods, and repetitions for a wide range of fitness activities including running, cycling, weightlifting, and more.  Pre-designed programs such as "Couch to 5k" will be offered to cater to users with different fitness levels and aspirations. The app with feature fitness tracking, program sharing, system notifications, and a user-friendly interface for seamless navigation and interaction. While the apps initial focus will be on the core functionalities essential for effective interval training, there exists the potential for future expansion and enhancement based on user feedback and evolving fitness trends. Overall, the Interval Training App aims to encourage users to optimize their workouts, achieve their fitness goals, and lead healthier lifestyles.

#### Limitations/Constraints:

There are several limitations and constraints that need to be considered for the Interval Training App including:
1.	**Time Constraints:** With approximately a 10-weeks allocated for development, there is a limited timeframe to implement all proposed features and functionalities. This may require prioritization of tasks and features to ensure that essential functionalities are completed.
2.	**Scope Limitations:** The extensive feature set, including custom interval training routines, pre-designed programs, fitness tracking, sharing programs, multiple types of interval training and system notifications, presents a substantial development scope. This may prove challenging to fully implement all features within the given timeframe and resources.
3.	**Technical Complexity:** Complex features such as fitness tracking, sharing functionalities, and real-time notifications may require additional time and resources to fully implement.

## Technology Stack:
- Programming Language: Java
- Frameworks: JavaFX 
- Database: SQLite (works well with android and have previous experience with)
- Other Technologies: 
  • google maps API: For anything location based
  • Can consider using Android studio IDE instead of IntelliJ

## Development Methodology:
The Interval Training App will follow the Agile Scrum methodology, which incorporates iterative development, collaboration, and flexibility. The project will be divided into time-boxed iterations called sprints, lasting two weeks. Sprint planning meetings will see the development team selecting user stories from the product backlog to be implemented in the upcoming sprint based on their prioritization. Each user story represents a specific feature or functionality of the app.

Once the sprint backlog is established, the development team will work to implement the selected user stories. Weekly meetings will be conducted to provide an update on the project's progress, discuss any complications, and adjust plans as needed. The focus of each sprint is to provide increments of functionality, ensuring that essential features are delivered first.

By adopting the Agile Scrum methodology, the team will be able to quickly react to changing requirements, mitigate risks, and deliver a high-quality Interval Training App that meets the needs and expectations of its users.

## Timeline:
#### Week 1-4: Getting Ready for the Project
-	Form a group. 
-	Decide on a project idea.
   
#### Week 5: Inception and Setup (Milestone 1)
- **Java Readiness:** you have completed your homework for weeks 1-4. 
-	**Team Formation:** you are in a team and the team was registered in Activity 2.5 - Project Brief and Team Forming: Register your group for the project Copy. 
-	**Project Requirements:** you have defined a project brief and have created an initial list of requirements. 
-	**Project Repository:** you have created a GitHub project, and the team is sharing source code and resources. 

#### Week 7: Planning and Design (Milestone 2)
-	**User Stories:** the students have created ~20 user stories for the project (20 stories for a team of 5). 
-	**Project Management Tool:** the team has adopted a PM tool and is using it to manage the project. 
-	**Release and First Sprint Plan:** the team has completed a first sprint plan (week 5-7). 
-	**UI Design (Low/Medium Fidelity):** The team has created a design for the Graphical User Interface. 

#### Week 9: Implementation and Quality Assurance (Milestone 3)
-	Prepare for the sprint review meeting by ensuring all sprint goals and deliverables are met.
-	**Functional Prototype:** The project has a functional user interface and stores data in a DB for persistence. 
- **Test-Driven Development:** the project includes a suitable test suite. 
-	**Version Control Workflow:** There is evidence of regular commits to repositories and proper source management practices (e.g. branching). 

#### Week 11: Continuous Integration (Milestone 4)
-	**Enhanced Prototype:** Most Features have now been implemented as they were detailed in 'Must Have' user stories. 
- **Build Script:** Build and Tests are automated using a build script in GitHub. 
-	**Automated Build Server:** GitHub 'Actions' are in place to automate the CI/CD process. 

#### Week 13: Final Submission and Deployment (Milestone 5)
-	**Final Prototype:** Your final project will include a functional UI, Persistence saving to a local DB, and will implement all 'Must Have' user stories as specified at Checkpoint 2 (and updated throughout the semester). 
-	**Demo:** a 5 minute video in which you walk an imaginary 'client' through all main functionalities of the software showing it in action. The demo should describe the software from the perspective of a user, rather than delve into technical details.  

## Resources:
(What resources will you need? This could include developers, testers, software, hardware, etc.)

## Risks & Mitigation Strategies:
Potential risks that could impact the Interval Training App and their mitigation strategies include:

#### Technical Complexity:
-	**Risk:** The inclusion of various features and functionalities (e.g., fitness tracking, sharing programs, system notifications) may introduce technical complexities, leading to development delays or implementation challenges.
-	**Mitigation:** Divide the project into smaller tasks and prioritize core functionalities. Consider technical capabilities before committing to implementing additional complex features. 

#### Resource Constraints:
-	**Risk:** Limited availability of team members, a short timeframe of ~10 weeks and potential unexpected departures could impact project progress and quality.
-	**Mitigation:** Establish clear communication expectations. 

#### Scope Creep:
-	**Risk:** Implementing additional features, outside of the project's original scope, may lead to scope creep causing delays.
-	**Mitigation:** Define a clear project scope and prioritize features based on their importance and alignment with project objectives.

## Success Criteria:
(Define what success looks like for this project. Is it a certain number of users? Specific functionality?)

## Approval:
(Approval from the project owner or stakeholder)
